# TreasureHunt_RL
Hi everyone! This reposititory will be about my holiday adventure with reinforcement learning. During my Master program I followed multiple agent courses and wanted to know more of the topic of reinforcement learning. 
I am studying the reinforcement learning book of Surton Barton and following the UCL David Silver lectures online.
## Game
To implement the algorithms I have created a very simple game called TreasureHunt. This game is a gridworld game, as in the book, but then with the goal to find a treasure! 
So far I created two versions treasure_hunt_with_walls and without_walls. the with_walls will be focussed on because then I can create more complex levels to solve :P. 

## Algorithms
As algorithms I have implemented value iteration as combination of policy evaluation and iteration.
When running both files you will get two matrices as output. 
One represents the policy and the other represents the values for every state. 

## Future
In the future I hope to implement Monte Carlo and Temporal difference methods.
